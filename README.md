Arrays 1

Let's start off with some basic array practice. In this task we'd like you to create an array of three items, stored inside a variable called myArray. The items can be anything you want â€” how about your favorite foods or bands?

Next, modify the first two items in the array using simple bracket notation and assignment. Then add a new item to the beginning of the array.
